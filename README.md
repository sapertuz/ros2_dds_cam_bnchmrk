# ROS 2 DDS Camera Benchmark

Benchmark DDS performance in ROS 2 using a 4K@60FPS rosbag stream. Measures latency, frame drops, and QoS tuning effects.

If you do not have a machine with Linux and/or ROS 2 installed, please refer to the [README_docker.md](README_docker.md) for instructions on building and using a Docker container to run these benchmarks easily.
